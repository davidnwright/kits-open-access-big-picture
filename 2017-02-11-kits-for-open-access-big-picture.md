What follows here is a big-picture statement about what the kits in the open access series are meant to encourage. In general, the kits are meant to be used in the classroom by students or by individuals who might want to kickstart their research or critical thinking practices--a larger community that could extend outside institutions of higher education. 

This project borrows from many critical currents swirling around innovative teaching and research practices involving making, technology, and social themes underway in academic circles. Notably, [Garnet Hertz and his concept of "Critical Making"](http://current.ecuad.ca/what-is-critical-making) in conjunction with [Mark Ratto](http://criticalmaking.com/matt-ratto/) and the Critical Making Lab at the University of Toronto; the work of Jentery Sayers and others at the [University of Victoria's "Maker Lab" in the Humanities](http://maker.uvic.ca/about/), [Kari M. Kraus](https://www.english.umd.edu/profiles/kkraus) is a big influence, as is [Lori Emerson](https://loriemerson.net/). 

As well, the project extends the work of many groups, sanctioned or otherwise, who think about the humanities in new ways. I'll name a few here: [The Scholar's Lab](http://scholarslab.org/about/), [Maryland Institution for Technology in the Humanities (MITH)](http://mith.umd.edu/), The [Media Archeology Lab](https://mediaarchaeologylab.com/about/), The [Electronic Textual Cultures Lab at The University of Victoria](http://etcl.uvic.ca/) and the closely related [Implementing New Knowledge Environments (INKE)](http://inke.ca/) research group and [Digital Humanities Summer Institute](http://www.dhsi.org/). There are many, many, many others who have influenced and impacted this project who are not listed here, but this is a start, and serves as a broadly-stated sweep of sources as they currently stand. 






**Over-Arching Concepts (In Inverse Order)**

- Exhibition (the kit must yield some kind of physical display)  
- Prototyping and Fabrication (the kit must involve making or trying to make something material or digital)
- Organizing and Cataloguing (the kit must teach critical skills in organization and cataloguing)
- Questions and Theses (the kit should teach individuals by being a catalyst for questions, research, and theses)
- Play and Indeterminate Spaces (the kits should reveal thematic structures (gender, sex, race, culture, economies of labour, etc., through play and by emphasizing ambiguity)
- Collaborative and Individualized (the kits should work for both group and individual learning environments)
